Push Swap is an algorithmic sorting project. It challenges you to sort a stack of integers 
using a limited set of operations and two stacks, while minimizing the number of moves.

The program takes a list of integers as input and outputs the optimal sequence of operations to sort them in ascending order.

ðŸ“‹ Project Goals
  - Develop a deep understanding of algorithm optimization.
  - Practice data structures like stacks, linked lists, and arrays.
  - Implement efficient sorting logic using limited commands.
  - Minimize time and space complexity while keeping code clean and modular.
